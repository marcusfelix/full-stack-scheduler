# Full Stack Scheduler (WIP)

Simple full stack application for call scheduling using `React.js`, `Tailwind`, `Express.js` and `Prisma`. 

Nothing fancy but some cool aspects:
- Custom `DatePicker` component
- Custom `Toast` component
- Clean folder structure
- Abstracted service calls

## To-do
[X] Extend `Toast` to handle messages Simultaneously

[ ] Display `Event` details on "/done" route

[ ] Implement better `Auth`: Refresh tokens?
